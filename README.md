# Ember-cli-string-module-loader

This addon is a fork of [loader.js](https://github.com/ember-cli/loader.js) with the exception that it
understands how to read lazily evaluated AMD modules aka string modules. The string modules are generated by the [ember-cli-lazy-code](https://github.com/chadhietala/ember-cli-lazy-code) addon and this addon just
understands the new format while still being backward compatible with the old version.

This addon should be used in conjunction with [ember-cli-lazy-code](https://github.com/chadhietala/ember-cli-lazy-code) which creates an AST transform
to lazily evaluate AMD modules.
